INST-377 Project 
Our group decided to create a program that functions similiar to the application, Tinder, however, instead with movie suggestions. Users are able to swipe right to like a movie, and swipe left to dislike a movie. The application then generates a list of movies based off what the user has liked, and outputs it. The database our group used was the OMDB database which is an Open Movie Database, which contains specific details about movies, such as the year released, genre, runtime, main actors, and ratings. As some of this data is extremely relevant for finding movies of the same quality, we decided to focus on the genre, and ratings.

The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by our users.
