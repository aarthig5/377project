###### Link to where your app is running
- Link to Heroku Webpage!

###### Information problem you're trying to solve
- No method of finding new movies without searching through Google or through word of mouth. 

###### Identified stakeholders/target browsers
- Our stakeholders are college students (18-24), teens, and peopel who use entertainment streaming services who would like something more personalized, and be able to conduct a quick movie search. 

###### Data you chose to work with
- Dataset to use:
  - OMDb API for movies Link to Data

###### Chosen strategies and solutions for the problem
- We built a web application for users to be able to look up different movies, and get details regarding their searches. 

###### Technical system decision rationale
- For this project, we did not use any new libraries or packages due to time constraints. We used the OMDb API database which required authorization through an API key. 

###### How/if your final system helps to address the problem
- The main problem that we hoped to address was providing users with a quick web application that allows them to search for movies, and get details about the movies. This way users can use this website to decide if they want to watch a movie or not through a simple search method. 

###### Challenges faced and impact on final design
- Understanding how API keys work in order to establish a connection the API server to our program. 
- Faced difficulty in outputting the data of the search results to the page due to the unique values in the list. 
- Too many requirements to fulfill for the project in a short time frame. 
- Difficulty utilizing the database, and organizing movies based on specific variables, such as title, genre, and year. 
- Understanding how to create a carousel like swipe method via Javascript. 
- Because of the API key, we couldn't access certain information from the API. 

###### Possible future work directions with this problem
- Expanding the data to be organized by other aspects, such as run time, rating, and lead actors, which would allow for deeper analytical insight in terms of the suggestion for the user.
- Collaborations with other organizations in the movie industry for utilizing our program to suggest movies to their audience. 
- Expanding to a design similar to the app, Tinder, that first begins by showing the user popular movie titles, followed by their cover. The user can then swipe left, to dislike a movie suggestion, or swipe right, to like a movie suggestion. The application then suggests movies that are similar to those the user liked, such as on aspects, like genre and actors.
